      "reportExplanation": "This report provides a comprehensive overview of the network performance tests conducted using the P4-based 1 Tb/s traffic generator (P4TG). The P4TG is utilized to generate high-speed network traffic, enabling the evaluation of various network parameters under controlled conditions. These tests are designed to measure the network's ability to handle high-speed data transfer, ensuring both efficiency and reliability. Key metrics such as packet loss, round-trip time (RTT), inter-arrival times (IAT), and jitter were recorded to provide insights into the network's performance. The following sections summarize the recorded statistics in the form of data and corresponding graphs, highlighting the network's strengths and identifying potential areas for improvement.",
      "rfcExplanation": "The Request for Comments (RFC) 2544 outlines a standardized testing methodology to assess the performance of network devices operating at Layer 2 of the ISO/OSI model. This methodology enables consistent comparisons across different manufacturers and devices. In this test run, several of the RFC 2544 tests were conducted, including the throughput test, which determines the maximum data rate (measured in frames per second) at which no frames are lost. Latency was also measured, specifically the one-way latency, which is the time it takes for a frame to travel from the source to the destination device. Additionally, the frame loss rate was assessed to quantify the percentage of frames that were not successfully forwarded by the device under test (DUT) under constant load conditions. Finally, the reset test was performed to measure the time required for the DUT to resume normal operation after a device or software reset."
